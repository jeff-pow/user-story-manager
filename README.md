# User Story Manager

This program was created as a school assignment. It is able to keep track of user stories for program 
requirements for many different projects simultaneously. It can read and print current state of the program
to formatted files for longevity.

GUI code was provided alongside UML class diagram with descriptions of what the given methods should
do. All other code and tests were written from scratch. GUI can be started from the 
RequirementsManagerGUI class' main method. Start interacting with program via the file button in the top 
left of the popup window.

Tests must be run with P1/ as the base directory because all file IO tests use the aforementioned 
directory for relative file paths.
